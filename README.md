# Physics Simulation Engine

## Overview
Developing this physics simulation engine to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and explore my interest in physics. This project allowed me to combine my curiosity for physical interactions with practical coding experience, resulting in a tool that simulates realistic physical behaviors.

This physics simulation engine is designed to simulate realistic physical interactions in a 2D environment, similar to Matter.js. It provides developers with the tools to create simulations involving collisions, forces, constraints, and more.

### Key Features

- **Body Dynamics**: Support for circles, boxes and others (in progress..)
- **Collision Detection**: Accurate and efficient collision detection and resolution(in progress..).
- **Forces and Impulses**: Apply forces and impulses to bodies for realistic movement.
- **Randomized ball generation**: Generatete bodies anywhere in plane using Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm.
